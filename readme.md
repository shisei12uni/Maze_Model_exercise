this is the exercise for week 3 preparation materials.
It involves both the Maze Model and the Maze Population.
The commit wasn't saved from the beginning. This is because I didn't understand how Github works, put the exercise .py file with my lecture notes then stashed the lecture notes which ended up with the notes disappearing. I decided to move the .py file to a different folder, which didn't work well with the repositories, and now I'm here trying to sort out what's the correct rocess to git stuff.
